TinyCLRS is a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python for study. Thanks
to the MIT open courseware, learning algorithms is more accessible than ever to everyone. The goal
of this project is to provide intutive examples of topics covered in courses from basic to
advanced including 6.006 and 6.046.
